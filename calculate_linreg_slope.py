def linreg_slope(series, length):
    """
    Calculates the slope of the linear regression line for a given series.

    The slope is a measure of the rate of change of the series over a specified period.
    It helps identify the direction and strength of the trend.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    series : pd.Series
        The input series (e.g., closing prices).
    length : int
        The lookback period for calculating the slope.

    Returns:
    -------
    float
        The slope of the linear regression line.

    Example Usage:
    --------------
    ```python
    slope = linreg_slope(data['close'], length=14)
    ```
    """
    x = np.arange(len(series))
    slope = np.polyfit(x[-length:], series[-length:], 1)[0]
    return slope
