# Technical Indicators

A Python library for computing commonly used technical indicators in financial markets. This repository provides efficient and easy-to-use implementations of indicators that are vital for analyzing market trends, generating signals, and backtesting strategies.

---

## üìä Supported Indicators

Currently, the library includes the following technical indicators:  
- **Supertrend**: Identifies trends and generates buy/sell signals based on volatility.  
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.  
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: Compares a specific closing price to a range of its prices over time.  
- **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: Quantifies trend strength and direction.  
- **Bollinger Bands**: Identifies overbought or oversold market conditions using a simple moving average and standard deviation.  
- **Heikin Ashi**: Smooths out price action for clearer trend identification.  

> üöÄ **Planned Additions**:  
> This library is a work in progress. We aim to continuously expand it by adding more indicators, including:  
> - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (**MACD**)  
> - Fibonacci Retracement Levels  
> - Ichimoku Cloud  
> - Pivot Points  
> - Average True Range (**ATR**)
